It follows a trunk-based approach. That is, it creates a pipeline that is triggered by a commit to the main branch of a git repo and deploys automatically to a test env. Furthermore, it creates a second pipeline tht is triggered manually to deloy the same branch to a prod env.

```hcl
module "cicd-pipeline" {
